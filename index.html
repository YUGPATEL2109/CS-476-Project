        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Rural areas in Saskatchewan have not been getting enough medical attention. This website is created for them so they can have consultations from their leisure. Our mission is to provide accessible and convenient healthcare services to the residents of rural Saskatchewan. We understand the challenges faced by people living in remote areas and aim to bridge the gap between them and quality medical care. Remote consultation allows patients to connect with healthcare professionals through video calls, eliminating the need for in-person visits. This is especially beneficial for people living in rural areas who may have limited access to healthcare facilities or face difficulties traveling long distances.</p>
